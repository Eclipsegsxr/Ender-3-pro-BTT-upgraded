# Ender-3-pro-BTT-upgraded
This is a fully upgraded skr mini e3 v2 with tft35 v3 board. I just got the latest marlin build 2.0.9.3 compiled and running. Got a few more tweaks and I'll post a firmware.bin for it. I aslo have all factory endstops in place and using BLTouch probe port on my setup. BLTouch homes at center of the bed, and alljumpers for sensorless homing must be removed.
